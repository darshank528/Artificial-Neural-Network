Hello Guys,
This is a stock prediction mini-project.

Till now in this part of assignment you have done implementation in tensorflow. 

Therefore in this project, I have added the code for tensorflow and your task is to convert the code in pytorch and try to improve the prediction if possible.

This is a utility project which will give you insight on how you have to work on with different tools and platform according to your needs.

Check out blog-post "Predict Stock Prices Using RNN": [Part 1](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/07/08/predict-stock-prices-using-RNN-part-1.html) and [Part 2](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/07/22/predict-stock-prices-using-RNN-part-2.html) for the tutorial associated.

 First download the full S&P 500 data from [Yahoo! Finance ^GSPC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=^GSPC) (click the "Historical Data" tab and select the max time period). And save the .csv file to `data/SP500.csv`.
